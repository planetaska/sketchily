# Sketchily

Sketchily allows the easy integration of [svg-edit](http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/) with any rails application.

Currently supports and provides `svg-edit-2.8.1`.

This is a branch for learning and experimenting purposes. If you need a working svg-edit after Google Chrome update 48, this may help you. Not guaranteed to work.

For stable version and installation/usage please visit [lml's original git](https://github.com/lml/sketchily).
